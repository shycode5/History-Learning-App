# History-Learning-App
The problem The Timeliner solves
Mainly to be used by middle school children to make learning history more fun and interactive. It makes the task of remembering dates as well as names of people in history easier with our VR game. The AR aspect of the game will include the user pointing their camera to the object which they think best relates to the event. For example, if the user points to a tree then the tree comes out in AR portraying animations of Chipko movement, and taping on it will speak the information of
movement.
